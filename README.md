I've added some CSS to the website. 

With the use of CSS, i've learned:

* change element size with height, width, padding, border and margin.
* positioning the element by manipulating the property mentioned above.
* change text color, background color, size and font family.
* the differences between block and inline box; 
* to properly use the 'display' property.
* box-sizing.
* specificity of the selector and rule order.
* all kinds of selector, which is universal, type, class, ID, grouping selector. also chaining and descend combinator.
